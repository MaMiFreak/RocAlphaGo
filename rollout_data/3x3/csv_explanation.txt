go4go_3x3_symmetries_8 -> find all rotational symmetries
go4go_3x3_symmetries_16 -> find all rotational & colour symmetries

----------------------------------

position on 1th line are not included as pattern would be partly outside board.

----------------------------------
tables in 3x3 csv files:
pattern_hash, pattern_occurence, pattern_chosen, amount_symmetries

----------------------------------
pattern hash:
#1 active_player_colour (1/2)
#8 stones: black, white, empty (0/1/2)
#8 liberties: liberty count (0/1/2/3)

example:
20001002000030030
active_player_colour: 2 (white)
stones liberties (max 3)
...    000
WX0    3X0
.B.    030

example:
22122200133333003
active_player_colour: 2 (white)
stones liberties (max 3)
WBW    333
WXW    3X3
..B    003

example:
12111101231131032
active_player_colour: 1 (black)
stones liberties (max 3)
WBB    311
BXB    3X1
.BW    032

----------------------------------
pattern_occurence:
how often does this pattern occur, also
counting all occurences in a game even when player does not play at X

----------------------------------
pattern_chosen:
how often this pattern occurs in a game when player does play at X

----------------------------------
amount_symmetries:
how many symmetries are included

example:
20020020000300300;96;1;2 
stones:
00W
0X0
W00

only two symmetries exist
00W W00
0X0 0X0
W00 00W
